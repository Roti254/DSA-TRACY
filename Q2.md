1.Memory Allocation:
   a.Arrays are contiguos block of memory with a fixed size at declaration.
   b.linked Lists are non-contiguos memory with each node containing data and a pointer to the next node.
 
   2.Performance:
   a.Arrays have a faster access time (O(1)) because they are contiguos in memory
   b.Linked Lists have a slower access time(O(n)) because they are non-contiguos in memory.
 
   3.Insertion and Deletion:
   a.Arrays have insertion and deletion very costly(O(n)) because elements need to be shifted.
   b.Linked Lists have insertion and deletion very efficient(O(1)) if you have a reference to the node, but O(n) if you need to find the node.
